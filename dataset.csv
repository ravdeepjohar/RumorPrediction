w/wtcisraelis.htm,4000 Israelis did not show up for work on the day of the WTC attacks,      This eRumor says that when the attacks took place on September 11 there was immediate mourning of 4000 Israelis who worked in the towers and who were killed.  Then according to the eRumor there was suddenly no mention of the Israeli losses.  That was because it has been discovered that none of them showed up for work that day.  The clear suggestion of the is that they were tipped-off about the planned attacks.  Presumably because of the pending attacks a decision was made to cancel a planned appearance by Premier Ariel Sharon. The report closes by saying that the FBI arrested five Israelis after the attack who were filming it and rejoicing over it.  The implication is that Israelis may have been responsible for the attacks.     This eRumor says that when the attacks took place on September 11 there was immediate mourning of 4000 Israelis who worked in the towers and who were killed.  Then according to the eRumor there was suddenly no mention of the Israeli losses.  That was because it has been discovered that none of them showed up for work that day.  The clear suggestion of the is that they were tipped-off about the planned attacks.  Presumably because of the pending attacks a decision was made to cancel a planned appearance by Premier Ariel Sharon.
